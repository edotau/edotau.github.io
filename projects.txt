3:T465,Hi-C libraries are commonly used today for assembling draft genomes largely because these libraries can provide insight into 3-D chromosome structures and investigate chromosome interactions in close proximity. A freshwater three-spine stickleback Hi-C library previously provided a noticeable improvement to the Gasterosteus aculeatus freshwater assembly [CL Peichel, 2017](https://academic.oup.com/jhered/article/108/6/693/3957968). However, Karyotype characterization in sticklebacks have previously reported to have a high divergence chromosomal morphology [Kitano 2009](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature08441), [Ross 2009](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19229325/). When we mapped previously generated freshwater Hi-C data to both the freshwater assembly and the marine stickleback genome revealed identical heat map signatures. Similarly, when we mapped marine Hi-C data against the freshwater and marine genomes respectively, produced the same Hi-C heat map profiles suggesting both assemblies are high contiguity chromosome level assemblies, but no large detectable chromosomal rearrangements or translocations.0:["9Sz8jBDPIxy2-xXBrfl_P",[[["",{"children":["projects",{"children":["__PAGE__",{}]}]},"$undefined","$undefined",true],["",{"children":["projects",{"children":["__PAGE__",{},[["$L1",["$","div",null,{"className":"card","children":[["$","h4",null,{"children":"Genomic Software Projects"}],["$","p",null,{"children":["Website:"," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"http://www.vertgenlab.org/","target":"_blank","children":"vertgenlab"}],["$","a",null,{"href":"https://github.com/vertgenlab/gonomics","target":"_blank","children":"github.com/gonomics"}]]}],["$","p",null,{"children":["GoFish:"," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"https://github.com/edotau/goFish","target":"_blank","children":"github.com/edotau/goFish"}]]}],["$","p",null,{"children":["Documentation:"," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/edotau/goFish","target":"_blank","style":{"color":"#007bff"},"rel":"noreferrer","children":"https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/edotau/goFish"}]]}],["$","p",null,{"children":["Bash Scripts:"," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"https://github.com/edotau/sticklebackCipher","target":"_blank","children":"sticklebackCipher"}]]}],["$","h4",null,{"children":"Genomic Basis of Adaptive Evolution"}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Stickleback repeated adaptation to new environments provide a powerful mechanism to study the molecular genetics of evolutionary changes in wild populations.
