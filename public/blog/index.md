## Run IDONTMIND mental health awareness campaign

---

Hi everyone,

May is Mental Health Awareness Month and to make this year especially memorable, I am devoting my free time to support the Run IDONTMIND mental health campaign. I am organizing an in-person 5k in the sf area as well as a virtual 5K for my best friends from all around the world. It would mean the world to me if you could help support a cause Iâ€™m deeply passionate about.

Help support the mental health awareness campaign either in-person or virtually, running or walking any distance of your choice. Whether it be a mile, 5k or even a half marathon; any distance will help inspire conversations about how much YOUR mind matters.

## How does nature evolve more stickles on sticklebacks?

Julia's paper is now live on bioRxiv! Her research focuses on genetic mechanisms that lead to regulatory changes in the HOX gene cluster, specifically the HOXDB variant allele. Julia beautifully illustrated how different mutational mechanisms affecting the same region may produce opposite gene expression changes with similar phenotypic outcomes. Follow the link down below for the entire paper!

## Do I have a favorite scientist?

- [Mary-Claire King](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6307974/pdf/jci-129-126050.pdf)

One of my most favorite scientist of all time is in fact Mary-Claire King. While she is probably most famous for her work on the breast cancer gene BRCA1, I am a bigger fan of her work that changed our view of evolution when she demonstrated protein-coding DNA sequences of humans and chimpanzees are 99% identical.
