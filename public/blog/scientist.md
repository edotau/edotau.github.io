# Favorite Scientist

One of my most favorite scientist of all time is in fact Mary-Claire King. While she is probably most famous for her work on the breast cancer gene BRCA1, I am a bigger fan of her work that changed our view of evolution when she demonstrated protein-coding DNA sequences of humans and chimpanzees are 99% identical. - [Mary-Claire King](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6307974/pdf/jci-129-126050.pdf)
