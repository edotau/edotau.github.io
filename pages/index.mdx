# Welcome to my life
<div>
  <p>
    Hello Hello!! I studied Applied Mathematics & Computer Science and my love for developmental biology pushed me to develop a variety of skills in both computer science and molecular genetics. My previous projects combine computational methods with a deep understanding of high throughput genetic sequencing of recombinant DNA.

    I love learning about interesting topics in software engineering, cloud computing, genetics, and genomics. I am terrible at golf, but hope to be good enough one day to play at Torrey Pines. I enjoy power lifting, badminton and watching nfl football and nba basketball. Most importantly, I dream about redefining the boundaries of success and hard work and prioritize being happy.
