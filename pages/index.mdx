# Welcome to my life
<div>
  <p>
    Hello Hello!! I studied Applied Mathematics & Computer Science back in college and my love for developmental biology pushed me to develop a variety of skills in both computer science and molecular genetics. My previous projects combine computational methods with high throughput genetic sequencing to capture connections between genetic mechanisms and regulatory elements or gene expression.

    I love learning about interesting topics in software engineering, cloud computing, genetics, and genomics. I am terrible at golf, but hope to be good enough one day to play at Torrey Pines. I enjoy power lifting, badminton and watching nfl football and nba basketball. Most importantly, I dream about redefining the boundaries of success and hard work and prioritize being happy.
